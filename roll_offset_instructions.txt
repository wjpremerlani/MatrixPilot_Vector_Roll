This branch implements the helical turn method for roll control, which uses a cross product.
This was done to reduce the risk of a flip over due to the introduction of a new feature, "Arduino" roll offset.

The following parameters are no longer needed or used in options.h.
You will get a warning if they are defined, but otherwise there is no harm:

YAWKP_AILERON
AILERON_BOOST

In place of YAWKP_AILERON, define MAXIMUM_LATERAL_ACCELERATION, which is the maximum desired
lateral acceleration desired during a turn, divided by gravity.

Typical value is 1.0 but anything between 0 and 4.0 is allowed.

An "Arduino" roll offset is supported, which will require the following new parameters in options.h:

ROLL_OFFSET_INPUT_CHANNEL
ROLL_OFFSET_MAXIMUM  // in degrees, such as 5.0
