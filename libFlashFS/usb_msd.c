//The LUN variable definition is critical to the MSD function driver.  This
//  array is a structure of function pointers that are the functions that 
//  will take care of each of the physical media.  For each additional LUN
//  that is added to the system, an entry into this array needs to be added
//  so that the stack can know where to find the physical layer functions.
//  In this example the media initialization function is named 
//  "MediaInitialize", the read capacity function is named "ReadCapacity",
//  etc.
